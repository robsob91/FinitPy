This is the repository for FinitPy, a Python 3 library for communicating with [finit.co](https://finit.co).

**Warning:** zero documentation ahead. Use at your own risk.

*finitclient.py* is the library

*finitcli.py* is the CLI client

*finitgui.py* is a GUI client written using tk

None of the clients are complete and lack support for important features such as new PM notifications and polls.
